PUBERTY


PURPOSE.
This language's code is supposed to resemble a pubertal masturbation procedure.
It is not intended to find use in public business.
The language was written to explore a new way of programming.


FUNCTIONAL PRINCIPLE.
The program begins by stating the date and the time, then the person is introduced,
and the kinks are listed, arousement level strongest to weakest. After that short
intro, the real code follows.
There are 6 byte-sized registers(A,B,C,D,E,F), all starting with value 0, which are used to manipulate data,
and a register pointer(called REGPTR), which is initialized with 0.
After an instruction is executed, the following code is executed: `REGPTR%=6 ; REGISTERS[REGPTR]%=256`.


INTRO.
First comes the date sentence. American date notation is used; the time zone is GMT.
Example:

  It is August 15, 2018, 04:32:06 PM.

This initializes $D to 1534350732(the Unix timestamp of the date)%256.

Second sentence uses the pattern `<CHARACTER> is in his bed, bored.`
Example:

  Izu is in his bed, bored.

This initializes $C to 3, the character count of the character's name.

Third sentence uses the pattern `(His|Her|Their) secret (kink is|kinks are) <kink1>(, <kinks>).`
Example:

  His secret kinks are fatfurs, inflation, growth and kitsunes.

Now the word "fatfur" = 5, "inflation" = 4, "growth" = 3 and "kitsunes" = 2.
This'll come in handy soon.

Fourth sentence(optional) uses the pattern `(Suddenly|Then) ((he|she) spots|they spot) <kink>.`
!The matching personal pronoun from sentence 3 MUST be used here!
Example:

  Suddenly he spots fatfurs.

This initializes $A to 2^<kink>; so in this case $A=2^5=32.
If this sentence is left out, $A=0.

Fifth sentence is "(Suddenly|Then|Soon) the following sounds become audible."
!This sentence needs to conclude the introduction!
After that, the program code follows.
ALL KEYWORDS EXCEPT FOR `OMG MOM GET OUTTA HERE` ARE CASE-INSENSTIVIE


KEYWORDS.
fap                     - increments the register pointed to by REGPTR by 1
ugh                     - zeroes the value of the current register
<kink>,fuck             - increments the register pointed to by REGPTR by the value of <kink> | IF USED ONCE, IT HAS A COOLDOWN OF 2^<KINK-2> FAPS
<kink>,hnng             - increments the register pointed to by REGPTR by 2^<kink> |  IF USED ONCE, IT HAS A COOLDOWN OF 2^<KINK-1> FAPS
yeah                    - increments REGPTR by 1
yes                     - print the ASCII value of the current register
oh                      - input an ASCII char into the current register
OMGMOMGETOUTTAHERE      - immediately halts the program | MUST BE ALL UPPERCASE
sigh                    - immediately halts the program
squirt                  - equivalent to `yes yeah yes yeah yes yeah yes yeah yes yeah yes yeah`
ngh <comment> hhh       - comment, will not be evaluated
hrg <loop> mmf          - loop until current register is zero
